A company has a bug bounty program, but they don't want mediation from a platform. So what do they do? Where can they publish? 

A bounty hunter wants to find independent bounty programs, so where does he look?

Here! I ran into this problem and decided to fix it by creating this list.

### Why do you hate platforms?

I don't! I just don't think they should be a prerequisite for getting the word out about a new bug bounty program.

### I want to publish a bug bounty program here

Make an issue!

### Thanks!

No problem!

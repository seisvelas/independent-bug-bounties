I am building an up to date list with every independent bug bounty provider with basic details and links

Does your company run such a program? Create an issue and we'll include you!

### Why?

Getting the word out about a bug bounty can be hard if you don't use platforms like HackerOne and BugCrowd. Similarly, finding independent programs can be be challenging. 

Eventually this could be a site, a kind of nonplatform platform (in that it's free to publish and unmediated). For now we just need to build the data and see if it is useful.

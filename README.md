This is a maintained list of every independent bug bounty platform. Our goal is to provide companies with an easy, free way to
spread the word about their bounty programs, without having to resort to bug bounty platforms like HackerOne or BugCrowd. 

We have nothing against platforms, merely we think there is a valid space for independent programs as well, that we hope to nurture

Does your company or project run a bug bounty program that you'd like to see mentioned here? Create an issue to let us know
and we'll make sure to get it included :)
